## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio! I am a dedicated professional who graduated with a specialization in data analytics from [Staffordshire University](https://www.staffs.ac.uk/), achieving a commendable CGPA of 3.78 out of 4.00. With three years of hands-on experience in data engineering and a background in freelancing within the realm of data science, I have honed my skills and developed a profound understanding of the intricacies of data.

Throughout my journey, I have undertaken various projects ranging from supporting proof-of-concept endeavors for companies as well as to participating in competitive challenges, all centered around leveraging data science and AI technologies. My passion for data extends beyond the professional realm; I am deeply enthusiastic about the potential of data to transform industries and drive innovation.

As an aspiring end-to-end data specialist, I continuously strive to expand my expertise, bridging the gap between data acquisition, processing, analysis, and interpretation. This portfolio serves as a testament to my commitment to excellence and showcases my proficiency in navigating the dynamic landscape of data analytics and engineering. Not only that, my learnings are fundamental focused, hence I am very much comfortable adapting to new technologies. 


## Sample Projects

### Project 1 : EY data science Challenge 2024
- **Challenge goal**: Develop a machine learning model for identifying damaged and undamaged coastal infrastructure (both residential and commercial buildings) affected by natural disasters like hurricanes or cyclones.
- **Data provided**: Pre- and post-cyclone satellite images of areas impacted by Hurricane Maria in 2017.
- **Objectives**: Build a machine learning model capable of detecting four types of objects in cyclone-affected satellite images.





### Project 2 : Proton RAG. 

Proton_RAG is a chatbot that provides information regarding a Malaysian car called Proton Saga. It uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide context from a pre-loaded PDF document that contains more information about the Proton Saga. The chatbot can answer questions about the car's features, specifications, history, and price. It can also generate creative content related to the car, such as poems, stories, code, and songs. This project is meant to be integrated into a carlist aggregation website.
